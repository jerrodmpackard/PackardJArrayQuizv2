Array Quiz V2
Completed an array quiz for the second time. Did a lot better this time around! Thanks for going over the quiz last time and for spending extra time going over these higher order methods. They make a lot more sense now. 

Please see the console for the boolean response on questions 5 and 5b.

I'm not sure if returning just the names for the extra credit questions is okay, but I wanted to try.
